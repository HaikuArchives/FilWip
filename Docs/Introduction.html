<P>This introduction section is for you newbies or the type who actually read documentation before trying out the app.</P>

<P>FilWip is a disk maintainance utility. Its a small program that helps you keep your hard disk clean from unwanted data, such as temporary files, logs, caches etc. that accumulate usually in the background, and if you are a casual user you might not be aware of them. If so, its time you are. Because you can free up space on your disk and keep your disk from accumulating outdated, unwanted data. </P>

<P>Temporary files apart, other data such as trashed files and folders, temporary files (stored in a hidden folders), system event logs (also stored in hidden folders) etc. also occupy some considerable disk space. Most of these files get automatically created and get created quite often. So as you may have realised cleaning all these items manually, traversing from folder to folder, and then emptying the trash can be a difficult, tedious and time consuming task. That was why FilWip was written.</P>

<P>FilWip makes this job as easy as possible implementing a graphical user interface. FilWip is a plugin-based app, meaning it's fully customizable and extensible. You can read about Plugins <A HREF="Plugins.html">here</A>, but you might want to look at the <A HREF="Interface.html">Interface</A> and <A HREF="HowToUse.html">How To Use</A> section first.</P>
