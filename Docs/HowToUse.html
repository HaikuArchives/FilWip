<P>Using FilWip is straight forward and simple. If you have used <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeOS Clean-Up Manager</FONT></I> before you can skip this section. If you are a newbie or the type that reads each bit of documentation before trying out this app then read on! </P>

<P>As you might have seen in the <A HREF="Interface.html">Interface</A> section, the main window loads all the plugins available and shows you the options. If you don't want to remove particular items you can choose not to do so by un-checking those options. For example some people, for whatever reason, have the habid of storing many files and folder in the Trash without deleting them, if you are one of them, you can un-check the Trashed Items option and FilWip won't touch the Trash.</P>

<P>Once you have selected the options you need to remove, click the <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Clean-Up!</FONT></B> button. You will have to confirm once that you are sure you wish to clean-up your disk (This confirmation can be disabled from <A HREF="Preferences.html#Confirm">Preferences</A>).</P>

<P>If you are brave enough to click "Yes" in the confirmation question (if there was a confirmation :), then the clean-up process will begin and will show you the progress of the operation.</P>

<TR><TD VALIGN=top><IMG SRC="images/progress.png"></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE=2>Once the progress completes, you will see a report. Details such as number of files cleaned, space recovered etc. will be shown. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>You can turn off the Report or toggle items shown in the Report through <A HREF="Preferences.html#Report">Report</A> panel in <A HREF="Preferences.html">Preferences</A>. Optionally you can ask FilWip to quit automatically after this operation. You can turn on that option <A HREF="Preferences.html#QuitApp">here</A>.</P>

<P>You can close FilWip while deleting is taking place. When you try to close it, the delete process operation is paused and you are given a confirmation of the quit. Clicking "Don't Force" to quit will resume the delete process. Clicking "Force" close will stop the delete process and quit FilWip.</P>

<P>Before using FilWip to clean-up your system close all interactive programs that are running. This isn't necessary 99.99% of the time, but in a rare situation, it can cause problems to other running applications. This is just a generic warning. So far for me it hasn't caused any problems when other apps are running neither have I received any flaws regarding this aspect from users.</P>

<P>This is because if a program has temporarily stored some critical data on the hard disk for any purpose, using FilWip may wipe out that data which could cause serious problems to that program. For 
example, while compiling a <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeIDE</FONT></I> project some temporary files are created but immediately deleted. Even at this infinitesimal time FilWip CAN (not necessarily "will") cause problems to that process and may result in fatal crashes. This has never happened before and may never happen... but there is always a first time.</P>

<P>So to avoid any risk whatsoever, after you have finished all your serious work, before shutting down just fire up FilWip once and then clean-up.</P>

<P>If you are too scared as to what might happen then do NOT use this utility. Don't think I am scaring you, its perfectly safe to remove all the items (options) from your system and this utility has been tested several times, but in case you feel it might be harmful to your system you have all the freedom in the world to quit and even delete FilWip from your system. Why I am saying this is that please don't email me saying "I used your utility and now so and so files are all deleted..", I hope you understand my position... So far I haven't received any mail like this and I hope I won't in the future too.</P>
