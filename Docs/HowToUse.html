<P>Using FilWip is straight forward and simple.</P>

<P>As you might have seen in the <A HREF="Interface.html">Interface</A> section, the main window loads all available plugins. If you don't want to remove particular items, un-check their checkboxes. For example, some people - for whatever reason - have the habit of storing many files and folder in the Trash without deleting them. If you are one of those, you can un-check the "Trashed items" option and FilWip won't touch the Trash.</P>

<P>Once you have selected the items you need to remove, click the <B><FONT FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#550088>Clean up</FONT></B> button. You will have to confirm that decision before the system is cleaned up. This confirmation can be disabled in the <A HREF="Preferences.html#Confirm">Preferences</A>.</P>

<A NAME="Progressbar"></A>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><IMG SRC="images/progress.png"></TD>
<TD VALIGN=top><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE=2>The clean-up process will begin after you clicked "Clean up" in the confirmation dialog. A progress bar informs of the cleaning process. When finished, a report will detail the number of files cleaned, space recovered etc.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>When finished, a Report summarized how many files/folders were deleted, how much disk space this freed, and how long it took. You can turn off the Report in the <A HREF="Preferences.html">Preferences</A>. You can make FilWip quit automatically after this operation there, too.

<P>FilWip can be closed while the clean-up is taking place. The delete process will then be paused and you'll be asked for confirmation to force the quitting. Clicking "Don't force" will resume the delete process, "Force" will stop the delete process and quit FilWip.</P>

<P>Before using FilWip to clean-up your system, close all interactive programs that are running. This isn't necessary 99.99% of the time, but in a rare situation it can cause problems for other running applications. For example, while compiling a project, many temporary files are created and deleted. FilWip interfering here, can cause crashes and other problems.<BR>
This is just a generic warning. So far, it hasn't caused any problems for me and I haven't received any such reports from users. But as they say, better be safe than sorry and finish all serious work before invoking FilWip...</P>
