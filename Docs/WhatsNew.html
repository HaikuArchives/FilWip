<P>This is the first public release of FilWip and since it is meant to be a replacement of the <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeOS Clean-Up Manager</FONT></I> it has the following differences - improvements and exclusions in comparison to its predecessor:</P>

<UL type=disc><FONT SIZE=2>
<LI><A HREf="Plugins.html">Plugins</A> &mdash; User-editable files that allow you to control what FilWip cleans.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="HowToUse.html#Progressbar">Progress bar</A> &mdash; Now FilWip shows the progress of the clean-up operation.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Preferences.html#LiveMonitoring">Live monitoring</A> &mdash; FilWip monitors changes to files it is supposed to delete "live".</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Interface.html#Overview">Overview</A> &mdash; FilWip shows overview of files - number of files, sizes</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Preferences.html#Items">Auto selection</A> &mdash; FilWip has several options for automatic selection of plugins.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Preferences.html#CheckInstall">Smart loading</A> &mdash; FilWip can load only those plugins that are appropriate to your system.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Preferences.html#SafeCheck">Safety Check</A> &mdash; Ensures your plugins don't delete files critical to your system.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="Preferences.html#Recurse">Recursive deletion</A> &mdash; Meaning, files inside sub-folders are also deleted.</LI>
</FONT></UL>

<P>These are just the features that FilWip has that its predecessor app did not have. Its full list of features are many more. FilWip is written in a much more efficient manner than <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeOS Clean-Up Manager</FONT></I>. Though the latest version cleaned up code, FilWip's code is more clean and efficient. FilWip fixes several problems through means of Plugins. Now all you people that wanted <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>Mozilla</FONT></I> support can have it in the form of a Plugin.</P>

<P>Some other features include:</P>

<UL type=" "><FONT SIZE=2>
<LI>... more preferences</LI>
<LI>... more efficient memory usage</LI>
<LI>... better synchronisation among threads</LI>
<LI>... completely generic, no paths hardcoded</LI>
</FONT></UL>

<P>The downside of FilWip? Yes it has one demerit in comparison to <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeOS Clean-Up Manager</FONT></I> as far as I know: It doesn't have Preview yet. I felt this isn't necessary anymore because Preview was needed by people who wanted to see what files will be deleted. Now that they have <A HREF="Interface.html#Overview">Overview infostrings</A> for this, I don't see a point in having a seperate Preview. Just seems like more pointless coding to me. Anyway, if many of you still want preview write to me, and if there is sufficient interest I will code it.</P>

<P>FilWip in terms of pure performance will be a touch slower than its predecessor. This is due to several reasons. First, because FilWip implements plugins, thus it has the ability to "filter" certain files while deleting. So checks are made for this for each file (or folder). Secondly, FilWip shows the progress bar while cleaning up - meaning updating the progress bar will take up CPU. Thirdly, FilWip counts all the files and folders before deleting (to show the progress of the whole operation) which its predecessor did not do.</P>

<P>But if you have a decent system, say ~600 MHz or higher, the performance will be very negligible. For in my 450MHz AMD K6-2 the performance was only about 0.5 to 1.2 seconds. As system speeds increase that will reduce drastically. Another advantage of FilWip is that it uses lesser memory despite the fact it spawns more than double the amount of threads <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Helvetica COLOR=#991122>BeOS Clean-Up Manager</FONT></I> uses.</P>
