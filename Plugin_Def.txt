:: Info ::

1. TYPE
	This must be either linear or hierarchial. Linear items are those that don't have any
	sub-items. Hierarchial is used to club several linear items into one category like NetPositive
	is a hierarchial item and has linear items such as Cookies, Cache, History etc.

2.  CHECK INSTALL OF
	This optional clause allows you to specify that if a certain file/folder (path to be precise)
	does not exist the plugin must not be used. For example if Opera isn't installed in the system,
	you can check the Settings folder of Opera here, if it isn't there Opera plugin will not load.

3. FOLDER | FILE
	Either FOLDER or FILE clause allows you to specify which folder / file to erase. When
	FOLDER is specified means all files within the folder and sub-folders will be in scope for
	deletion. Files inside sub-folders will be removed but not sub-folders itself.

4. EXCLUDE FILE | INCLUDE MIME
	EXCLUDE FILE is useful when you have specified a FOLDER path and you want to exclude
	a particular file inside that folder (as of now only exact name matching is done). For example,
	if you don't want the file named "hello.txt" NOT to be deleted in the FOLDER specified you
	can put hello.txt in the EXCLUDE FILE clause as EXCLUDE FILE=hello.txt. The file name you
	specify here is case-sensitive.

	INCLUDE MIME clause is similar to EXCLUDE FILE except you can check the mime-type of
	files before deleting. Only mime-types that are specified will be deleted (not left out).
	For example the Custom queries plugin will only include "application/x-vnd.Be-query" files
	to delete. Other files in the directory will be left untouched... Not this is INCLUDE and not
	EXCLUDE.

5. SECTION NAMES "[" and "]"
	The "[" (square bracket) indicates a section begin, or in other words either a linear or
	hierarchial item begins. "]" marks the end of the name. Keep your section names small,
	not too large as very large strings may not fit fully in the user interface of FilWip.
